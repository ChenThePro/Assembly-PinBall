# Assembly-PinBall
Assembly Pinball project

This project, "PinBall" is a project I have been working on for half a year in school. It is the final's year project in my computer science class of my school and it is worth 30% of my grade in the "Bagrot" of computer science in israel - 2 units for the "Bagrot".

The purpose of the project is to have fun and try to set a higher score each time. I had a blast time making it and experimenting with assembly which I hadn't known before. So I hope you would like it :)

I learnt and used a few tools to make this project. The keyboards buffer, the computers clock and more!!!.

I also added my project documentation that I submitted to my school for anyone to look at it. It contains pictures of my project, explanations and code references, it might not be up to date but it contains most of my work. For reading my code I recommend just reading the git file base.asm.

The documentation I submitted to my school is under the name of "Project portfolio(In Hebrew), contains: code documentation, explanations and more!", Keep in mind it is written in Hebrew but you could definitely just look at the pictures of the website and translate it with any software.
